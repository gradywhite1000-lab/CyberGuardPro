# 🛡️ CyberGuard Pro Website Redesign

## Project Overview
This repository contains the files for the comprehensive redesign and overhaul of the CyberGuard Pro corporate website. The goal of this project was to transform an outdated, overly-technical website into a clean, professional, and client-friendly platform. Our primary focus was simplifying cybersecurity concepts to effectively target and convert small business owners.

## Key Features Implemented

* **Simplified User Interface (UI):** Clean, modern, and professional layout designed to reduce intimidation and improve navigation.
* **Non-Technical Messaging:** Replaced technical jargon with clear, accessible language aimed at small business owners.
* **Self-Service Security Quiz:** An interactive, lead-generating tool that assesses a user's basic security posture and funnels qualified leads to a consultation.
* **Enhanced Lead Capture:** Focused Call-to-Action (CTA) elements to drive conversions.

## Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the web pages.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For a utility-first approach to styling, ensuring a clean and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements, including the security quiz logic and form handling.
